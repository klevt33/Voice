# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the browser navigation functionality to avoid bot detection when navigating to AI chat URLs at startup. The current implementation using Selenium's `driver.get()` method consistently triggers human verification challenges from AI chat services. The enhancement implements alternative navigation methods that are less detectable while maintaining a minimalistic approach and providing fallback to manual navigation when automatic methods fail.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to automatically navigate to the AI chat URL without triggering bot detection, so that I can use the application without manual intervention for human verification challenges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts and needs to navigate to an AI chat URL THEN the system SHALL first activate the browser window before attempting navigation
2. WHEN the browser window is minimized or inactive THEN the system SHALL restore and activate the window using the same method as topic submission
3. WHEN the current URL matches the target AI chat URL THEN the system SHALL skip navigation entirely
4. WHEN the current URL differs from the target AI chat URL THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic stealth navigation using alternative methods to `driver.get()`
5. WHEN automatic navigation succeeds THEN the system SHALL proceed with normal application flow
6. WHEN automatic navigation fails THEN the system SHALL display a status message instructing the user to navigate manually

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to use stealth navigation methods that avoid bot detection, so that I don't encounter human verification challenges during startup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN attempting automatic navigation THEN the system SHALL NOT use Selenium's `driver.get()` method as the primary navigation approach
2. WHEN implementing stealth navigation THEN the system SHALL use methods that simulate human-like browser interaction patterns
3. WHEN stealth navigation is attempted THEN the system SHALL verify navigation success by checking the current URL domain
4. WHEN navigation verification fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to the manual navigation workflow
5. WHEN using alternative navigation methods THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing browser interaction patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clear fallback to manual navigation when automatic methods fail, so that I can still use the application even when stealth navigation doesn't work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN automatic navigation fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear status message in the application's status line
2. WHEN manual navigation is required THEN the status message SHALL instruct the user to navigate to the appropriate URL manually
3. WHEN waiting for manual navigation THEN the system SHALL monitor the browser URL to detect when the user has completed navigation
4. WHEN manual navigation is detected as complete THEN the system SHALL automatically continue with normal application flow
5. WHEN manual navigation takes too long THEN the system SHALL assume completion and continue to avoid blocking the application

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the navigation enhancement to be minimalistic and not affect other browser interactions, so that the existing functionality remains stable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the navigation enhancement THEN the system SHALL NOT modify any existing browser interactions except URL navigation
2. WHEN the enhancement is active THEN topic submission, new chat button clicking, and all other browser interactions SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN implementing stealth navigation THEN the system SHALL use the existing browser window activation logic without duplication
4. WHEN adding new navigation methods THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing error handling and logging patterns
5. WHEN the feature is complete THEN the overall application complexity SHALL remain minimal with no significant architectural changes
