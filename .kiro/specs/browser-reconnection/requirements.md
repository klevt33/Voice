# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the issue where the application loses connection to the browser after extended periods of operation. Currently, when the browser session expires or the connection is lost, the application logs an error but does not attempt to recover. This results in a broken state where topics cannot be submitted, but the user interface does not clearly indicate the problem. The feature will implement automatic detection of connection loss, recovery mechanisms, and proper status reporting while preserving any pending topics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to automatically detect when the browser connection is lost, so that I'm aware of connection issues immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a browser operation fails with a session-related error THEN the system SHALL detect this as a connection loss
2. WHEN a connection loss is detected THEN the system SHALL log the detection with appropriate details
3. WHEN a connection loss is detected THEN the system SHALL update the status line to reflect the disconnected state
4. IF the error message contains "invalid session id" OR "session deleted" OR "browser has closed" THEN the system SHALL classify this as a connection loss

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to attempt automatic reconnection when the browser connection is lost, so that I don't have to manually restart the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a connection loss is detected THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect to the browser automatically
2. WHEN attempting reconnection THEN the system SHALL update the status line to indicate "Reconnecting..."
3. WHEN reconnection is successful THEN the system SHALL restore the chat page to a ready state
4. WHEN reconnection is successful AND browser is on correct page THEN the system SHALL update the status line to indicate successful reconnection
5. WHEN reconnection is successful BUT browser is not on correct page THEN the system SHALL show a warning message and consider reconnection successful
6. IF reconnection fails due to actual connection errors THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with increasing delays
7. IF all reconnection attempts fail THEN the system SHALL update the status line to indicate connection failure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want my selected topics to be preserved during connection loss and reconnection, so that I don't lose my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a connection loss occurs during topic submission THEN the system SHALL preserve the topics that were being submitted
2. WHEN reconnection is successful THEN the system SHALL retain all pending topics in the queue
3. WHEN reconnection is successful THEN the system SHALL maintain the selected state of all topics in the UI
4. WHEN reconnection is successful THEN the system SHALL not clear or modify any topics that were not successfully submitted

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the option to manually trigger a reconnection attempt, so that I can force a reconnection when needed or restart the browser connection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is running THEN the system SHALL provide a manual reconnection dropdown that is always visible in the UI
2. WHEN the user selects "Browser" from the reconnection dropdown THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect to the browser
3. WHEN manual reconnection is triggered THEN the system SHALL follow the same reconnection process as automatic reconnection
4. WHEN the user selects a reconnection option THEN the dropdown SHALL reset to its default state after the action is initiated

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear status messages that inform me about the connection state and any recovery actions, so that I understand what's happening with the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the browser connection is active AND on correct page THEN the status line SHALL display "AI Ready" with green indicator
2. WHEN the browser connection is active BUT not on correct page THEN the status line SHALL display warning message with orange indicator
3. WHEN connection loss is detected THEN the status line SHALL display "Connection Lost - Attempting Reconnection..." with orange indicator
4. WHEN reconnection is in progress THEN the status line SHALL display "Reconnecting to browser..." with orange indicator
5. WHEN reconnection succeeds AND browser is on correct page THEN the status line SHALL display "Reconnected - AI Ready" with green indicator
6. WHEN reconnection succeeds BUT browser is not on correct page THEN the status line SHALL display warning message with orange indicator
7. WHEN all reconnection attempts fail THEN the status line SHALL display "Connection Failed - Use reconnect button to retry" with red indicator
