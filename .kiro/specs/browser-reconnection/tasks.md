# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create connection monitoring infrastructure


  - Implement ConnectionMonitor class to wrap browser operations and detect connection failures
  - Add connection error classification logic for WebDriver exceptions
  - Create ConnectionState enum for tracking connection status
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4_

- [x] 2. Implement reconnection management system


  - Create ReconnectionManager class with exponential backoff retry logic
  - Implement attempt_reconnection method with configurable retry limits and delays
  - Add ReconnectionAttempt dataclass for tracking reconnection history
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.5, 2.6_

- [x] 3. Enhance BrowserManager with reconnection capabilities


  - Add cleanup_driver method for safe driver connection cleanup
  - Implement reinitialize_connection method to restore driver and chat page
  - Add test_connection_health method for connection validation
  - Create preserve_queue_state method to maintain pending topics during reconnection
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 4. Integrate connection monitoring into browser operations


  - Wrap all browser operations in BrowserManager with ConnectionMonitor
  - Update _browser_communication_loop to handle connection errors gracefully
  - Modify focus_browser_window and other browser methods to use monitored execution
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 3.1_

- [x] 5. Add UI status updates for connection states


  - Extend status_colors dictionary in UIView with new connection-related states
  - Add connection_lost, reconnecting, reconnected, and connection_failed status types
  - Update status message formatting for connection-related states
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [x] 6. Implement manual reconnection UI control


  - Add "Reconnect" dropdown to the UI alongside existing browser controls
  - Implement reconnect dropdown selection handler in UIController
  - Add dropdown options for Browser, Audio, and Both reconnection types
  - Wire manual reconnection to ReconnectionManager through app controller
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 7. Create comprehensive error handling and recovery flow


  - Implement connection loss detection in browser communication loop
  - Add automatic reconnection trigger when connection errors are detected
  - Ensure topic queue preservation throughout reconnection process
  - Add proper error logging and status updates during recovery attempts
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.1, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 8. Add connection health monitoring and testing
  - Implement periodic connection health checks in browser operations
  - Add connection validation before critical browser operations
  - Create test methods to verify driver session validity
  - Update health test to not treat wrong page as connection failure (consistent with startup flow)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.4, 2.5_

- [x] 9. Write unit tests for connection monitoring components




  - Create tests for ConnectionMonitor error classification logic


  - Test ReconnectionManager retry behavior with mocked failures
  - Verify exponential backoff timing and retry limits
  - Test connection state tracking and transitions
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.5, 2.6_

- [ ] 10. Write integration tests for reconnection flow
  - Test end-to-end reconnection process with simulated connection loss
  - Verify topic preservation during reconnection attempts
  - Test manual reconnection dropdown functionality
  - Validate UI status updates throughout reconnection process
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.2, 3.3, 4.2, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_
