# Audio Resilience Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the issue where the application encounters audio device failures when microphones are disconnected or become unavailable. Currently, when audio devices fail (such as when a headset is disconnected), the application logs repeated errors but does not attempt to recover. This results in a broken state where audio recording cannot continue until the application is restarted. The feature will implement automatic detection of audio device failures, recovery mechanisms, and proper status reporting while preserving the application's functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to automatically detect when audio devices fail, so that I'm aware of audio issues immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an audio operation fails with a device-related error THEN the system SHALL detect this as an audio device failure
2. WHEN an audio device failure is detected THEN the system SHALL log the detection with appropriate details
3. WHEN an audio device failure is detected THEN the system SHALL update the status line to reflect the audio disconnection state
4. IF the error message contains "errno -9999" OR "errno -9988" OR "stream closed" OR "device unavailable" THEN the system SHALL classify this as an audio device failure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to attempt automatic reconnection when audio devices fail, so that I don't have to manually restart the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an audio device failure is detected THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect to the audio device automatically
2. WHEN attempting audio reconnection THEN the system SHALL update the status line to indicate "Audio device reconnecting..."
3. WHEN audio reconnection is successful THEN the system SHALL restore audio recording to a ready state
4. WHEN audio reconnection is successful THEN the system SHALL update the status line to indicate successful reconnection
5. IF reconnection fails after the first attempt THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with increasing delays
6. IF all reconnection attempts fail THEN the system SHALL update the status line to indicate audio connection failure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want audio recording to resume automatically when devices become available again, so that I don't lose audio capture capability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an audio device becomes available after being disconnected THEN the system SHALL automatically resume audio recording
2. WHEN audio reconnection is successful THEN the system SHALL recreate audio streams for affected devices
3. WHEN audio streams are recreated THEN the system SHALL maintain the same recording configuration and settings
4. WHEN audio recording resumes THEN the system SHALL continue normal operation without requiring user intervention

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the option to manually trigger audio reconnection, so that I can force audio reconnection when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is running THEN the system SHALL provide a manual audio reconnection option in the UI dropdown
2. WHEN the user selects "Audio" from the reconnection dropdown THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect to audio devices
3. WHEN the user selects "Both" from the reconnection dropdown THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect both browser and audio
4. WHEN manual audio reconnection is triggered THEN the system SHALL follow the same reconnection process as automatic reconnection

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear status messages that inform me about the audio connection state and any recovery actions, so that I understand what's happening with audio devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio devices are working normally THEN the status line SHALL display normal operation status
2. WHEN audio device failure is detected THEN the status line SHALL display "Audio device [source] reconnecting..." with warning indicator
3. WHEN audio reconnection is in progress THEN the status line SHALL display reconnection progress information
4. WHEN audio reconnection succeeds THEN the status line SHALL display "Audio device [source] reconnected" with success indicator
5. WHEN all audio reconnection attempts fail THEN the status line SHALL display "Audio device [source] connection failed" with error indicator
6. WHEN multiple audio sources are affected THEN the status messages SHALL clearly identify which source (ME/OTHERS) is affected
