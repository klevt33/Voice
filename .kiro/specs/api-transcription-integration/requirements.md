# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The API Transcription Integration feature enhances the existing audio transcription processor by adding cloud-based transcription capabilities through the Groq API. This feature provides users with flexible transcription options, allowing them to choose between local GPU processing and cloud API services based on their hardware capabilities and preferences.

The system will automatically detect GPU availability and provide appropriate UI controls for switching between transcription methods. It includes intelligent fallback mechanisms to ensure transcription reliability regardless of the chosen method, and seamless runtime switching without data loss or application crashes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Environment-Based API Configuration

**User Story:** As a user setting up the application, I want to configure the Groq API key through environment variables, so that sensitive credentials are not hardcoded in the application and can be managed securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL read the Groq API key from the GROQ_API_KEY environment variable
2. WHEN the GROQ_API_KEY environment variable is not set THEN the system SHALL log a warning and disable API transcription functionality
3. WHEN the API key is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL detect this during API calls and provide appropriate error messaging
4. WHEN API functionality is disabled due to missing credentials THEN the system SHALL continue operating with local transcription only
5. IF both API credentials and GPU are unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent transcription functionality

### Requirement 2: GPU Availability Detection and UI Control

**User Story:** As a user with varying hardware capabilities, I want the application to automatically detect my GPU availability and provide appropriate transcription method selection controls, so that I can choose the best transcription option for my system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN it SHALL detect CUDA/GPU availability for local transcription
2. WHEN GPU is available AND API credentials are configured THEN the system SHALL display a checkbox to switch between local GPU and API transcription
3. WHEN GPU is not available AND API credentials are configured THEN the system SHALL automatically use API transcription and display the checkbox as disabled/grayed out
4. WHEN only GPU is available (no API credentials) THEN the system SHALL use local transcription and hide the API selection checkbox
5. WHEN the transcription method checkbox is toggled THEN the system SHALL immediately switch transcription methods without requiring application restart
6. WHEN GPU is available THEN the system SHALL default to local GPU transcription on application startup

### Requirement 3: Groq API Integration

**User Story:** As a user wanting cloud-based transcription, I want the system to integrate with the Groq Whisper API, so that I can transcribe audio even on systems without powerful GPUs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API transcription mode is selected THEN the system SHALL use the Groq Whisper API (whisper-large-v3 model) for transcription
2. WHEN sending audio to the API THEN the system SHALL convert audio segments to WAV format as required by the API
3. WHEN the API returns transcription results THEN the system SHALL process them using the same filtering logic as local transcription
4. WHEN API requests timeout or fail THEN the system SHALL log appropriate errors and trigger fallback mechanisms if configured
5. WHEN API rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully with appropriate retry logic
6. IF the API response format changes THEN the system SHALL handle parsing errors gracefully and log detailed error information

### Requirement 4: Seamless Runtime Transcription Method Switching

**User Story:** As a user managing transcription during active sessions, I want to switch between local GPU and API transcription methods without losing data or crashing the application, so that I can adapt to changing conditions or preferences in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching from GPU to API mode THEN the system SHALL complete any in-progress local transcriptions before switching
2. WHEN switching from API to GPU mode THEN the system SHALL wait for pending API requests to complete before switching
3. WHEN transcription method is changed THEN existing audio queues SHALL continue to be processed with the new method
4. WHEN switching transcription methods THEN the UI SHALL remain responsive and display appropriate status indicators
5. WHEN method switching is in progress THEN new audio segments SHALL be queued and processed once the switch is complete
6. IF switching fails due to system errors THEN the system SHALL revert to the previous working method and notify the user

### Requirement 5: Intelligent Fallback Mechanisms

**User Story:** As a user depending on reliable transcription, I want the system to automatically fall back to alternative transcription methods when the primary method fails, so that transcription continues working even when individual components have issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in GPU mode AND local transcription fails THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt transcription using the Groq API if available
2. WHEN in API mode AND the Groq API fails or times out THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt transcription using local GPU if available
3. WHEN fallback transcription succeeds THEN the system SHALL log the fallback event and continue normal operation
4. WHEN both transcription methods fail THEN the system SHALL preserve the audio data and notify the user of the failure
5. WHEN fallback is triggered multiple times THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff to prevent rapid switching
6. WHEN the primary transcription method recovers THEN the system SHALL automatically return to using the primary method
7. IF fallback attempts exceed configured retry limits THEN the system SHALL disable transcription temporarily and alert the user

### Requirement 6: Audio Format Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user with existing audio processing workflows, I want the API integration to work seamlessly with the current audio capture and processing system, so that transcription quality and functionality remain consistent regardless of the method used.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using API transcription THEN the system SHALL convert captured audio segments to the WAV format required by the Groq API
2. WHEN audio conversion is performed THEN the system SHALL maintain the same audio quality parameters (sample rate, channels) as local transcription
3. WHEN API transcription is complete THEN the results SHALL be processed through the same filtering and quality checks as local transcription
4. WHEN audio segments are too large for API limits THEN the system SHALL split them appropriately while maintaining transcription quality
5. WHEN audio format conversion fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and attempt fallback transcription if available

### Requirement 7: Configuration and Settings Management

**User Story:** As a user customizing transcription behavior, I want configurable settings for API integration parameters, so that I can optimize transcription performance and reliability for my specific use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring API settings THEN the system SHALL support configurable timeout values for API requests
2. WHEN configuring fallback behavior THEN the system SHALL support enabling/disabling automatic fallback mechanisms
3. WHEN configuring retry logic THEN the system SHALL support configurable retry counts and backoff intervals
4. WHEN settings are changed THEN the system SHALL apply them immediately without requiring application restart
5. WHEN invalid configuration values are provided THEN the system SHALL use safe defaults and log warnings
6. IF configuration files are corrupted THEN the system SHALL fall back to built-in defaults and continue operation

### Requirement 8: Status Monitoring and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user monitoring transcription performance, I want clear status indicators and feedback about which transcription method is active and its current state, so that I can understand system behavior and troubleshoot issues effectively.
