Based on the [SYSTEM INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL], analyze the latest interview fragments.
First, determine if the interviewer's question is BEHAVIORAL or TECHNICAL.
- If BEHAVIORAL ("Tell me about a time..."): Provide 2-3 STAR-based talking points from my resume that answer the question. Suggest a follow-up question for me to ask.
- If TECHNICAL ("What is.../Compare..."): Provide a concise "Knowledge Nugget" defining the concept, its value, a strength, and a pitfall. Then, link it to a specific project or skill from my resume.
Focus ONLY on providing actionable content. Do not assess my performance.
